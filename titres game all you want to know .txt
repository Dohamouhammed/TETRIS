Project Name: Tetris 

Project Description: A Tetris game that integrates AI algorithms (A* and Greedy) to automatically 
play the game. The AI makes decisions based on heuristic evaluation to optimize the piece placement,
 using either the Greedy algorithm for immediate gains or A* for longer-term planning.

AI Algorithm: A* (A-star) and Greedy Algorithms
